🕯️ Avignon Candle ⛪🌫️🔥,Comme des Garçons,,"Solemn, ritualistic, contemplative.

Superlative. CdG's scent creations are extraordinary, shocking, entrancing, revolting, mesmerizing, dangerous, psychotically violent. It depends. Avignon is at least three if not four of these and absolutely indispensable to anyone who wants a hypnotic experience. Not in the least understated, Avignon is almost aggressively transporting: The incense of an Orthodox church, dripping wax, liquid darkness, prayers dusted in spice. Better than this, there is not. — Chandler Burr

 Description:  Powerful and intense, Avignon evokes the medieval city in the south of France which surpassed Rome as the Catholic Church’s power center in the 14th century. It’s the scent of gothic cathedrals and Papal palaces, of tapestries imbued with centuries of incense. Of cold marble steps, holy relics and dark confessions. The recognizable smells of frankincense and myrrh open the high mass of Avignon, giving way to the almost eye-smarting, gloriously smoky and resinous heart. A dry vanilla and soft Roman chamomile dull the edges of this reverent fragrance. Beautiful, dark and mysterious, Avignon takes its place among the most talked about (and admired) of CdG’s entire line. (via luckyscent.com)
Notes:  Roman chamomile, cistus oil, elemi, incense, vanilla, patchouli, palisander, ambrette seeds
 Scent:  CdG Incense Avignon is a literal high-hat interpretation of midnignt mass.  All throughout its development, you smell dry smoke with a sticky dark solemn resin. It conjures memories of all my years attending Christmas Eve mass. You can see the swirls of smoke disperse up to the heavens.  A holy cloud eventually enveloping the entire cathedral.  It’s so smokey that it makes you want to cough and your eyes water. You can also smell antiquated wood and the cold damp stone pillars. There’s an intimacy, quietude, and reverence I feel when I smell this scent. Transparent as a stained glass rose window. It makes me want to whisper. To do so otherwise, would be sacreligious.
Sillage:  For me, this is an intimate fragrance. It stays close to the skin.
Longevity:  CdG Incense Avignon performs incredible for an EDT. I’ve been wearing this since 11 a.m. It’s 9:36 p.m. and still going strong.
Would I buy a full bottle?  Yes, definitely. It’s a beautiful scent and should be in every perfumista’s/o’s collection.
Pricepoint:  $$
Season and Occasion:  Winter evenings. Austere religious rituals.
Layering:  It’s beautiful worn alone but amazing layered over other scents. Katie Puckrik layered her Avignon over a vanilla fragrance on her wedding day. One perfume vlogger layered it over Shalimar and said it smelled beautiful under Shalimar’s woody vanilla. I like to layer it with Flourish Pomegranate Rose to create a dark Gothic fruity floral. Another great layering combo is with Regina Harris Frankincense Myrrh Rose Maroc, it adds a touch of sweetness.
Final Verdict:  This is such a beautiful fragrance it almost brings me to tears. This is one of those instances where you smell a fragrance and discover the art of perfumery. Bertrand Duchaufour is a genius in my opinion. He deserves a thousand genuflects! How he managed to stuff centuries of Catholic piety and repression in a bottle is beyond me. This further demonstrates his masterful craftsmanship. CdG Incense Avignon smells so real to me that I am overwhelmed with guilt. My penitant knees are sore from reciting too many Hail Marys, Our Fathers, and Glory Be’s. I can understand why Morrissey chose this as his signature scent and I wouldn’t be surprised if Avignon was his muse. It would explain why his lyrics were so gloomy and maudlin. (FYI..Morrissey also belongs to the Catholic Club.)
For devout incense lovers, Morrissey fans, and recovering Catholics.


Liturgical smoke. Frankincense, myrrh, cold marble, dark spice.

Avignon is not gentle. This is a candle that smells like a cathedral on fire—in the best way. Resinous incense and ancient woods flood the air. Holy smoke and centuries-old rituals. It is haunting, commanding, and transcendent.

Not sweet. Not soft. Not shy.

It smells like secrets, like stone, like sacred text read by candlelight. Pure gothic atmosphere.
