🌊 bvlgari Aqva 🌿💧🌬️🟢,Bvlgari,5,"Aquatic green. Seaweed, mandarin peel, mineral water, dry herbs.

","You're standing on a rocky Mediterranean coastline in a white linen shirt still damp from salt spray. The sea breeze carries the scent of crushed rosemary, mineral stone, and washed-up seaweed.

Not a beach day—this is early morning solitude on the rocks, sleeves rolled, watching the tide roll in.","- "Clean, aquatic, herbal, mineral."

# Here is the second row:

🌬 Bvlgari Marine 🍋🌿🌊🫧,Bvlgari,5,"Light marine citrus. Neroli, grapefruit, sea mist, white musk.
This smells like lemon blossom in a breeze. The citrus is soft and smooth, not zesty. Neroli and white musk make it clean and gentle, almost spa-like.
Not bold. Not spicy. Not deep.
A soft, soapy marine scent. Easygoing, clean, and non-intrusive.

Breezy, coastal, spa-day fresh","Neroli,grapefruit","Seaweed,rosemary","Virginia cedar,amber","marine,citrus,herbal,fresh",Aqua Blue 🌐,Cold,"Feels like wind blowing over ocean water—more transparent and breezy than the original Aqva.

WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE:

- ❄️ Ice water over beach pebbles
- 🌱 Crushed mint and pale citrus
- 🌬️ Transparent breeze off a dock

Like walking barefoot on wet wood planks before the sun is fully up — less structure than Aqva, but more openness. Fresh, airy, a clean reset.
","Ocean, beach","- What you'll think: "Lighter, breezier, a bit more synthetic than the original Aqva."
- Why it's similar but different: Less herbal, more marine-fresh and transparent.
- Caveat: May feel a little too airy or lacking in depth compared to the original
- Verdict: ✅ Still fits—but original Aqva likely feels more you


🧠 What You'll Smell:

- Lighter, cooler, and more transparent than the original Aqva
- Think: icewater + citrus peel + driftwood
- A little synthetic-fresh, but still restrained

🎯 How It Aligns With You:

- Less herbal, less grounded than Aqva PH
- A bit more frictionless, more "easy breezy"
- Could feel too thin or too anonymous if you're looking for gravitas

⚖️ Verdict: 
Nice, but not as emotionally rich as Aqva PH

- Works best as your "I don't want to smell like cologne, but I want to smell clean" day scent
